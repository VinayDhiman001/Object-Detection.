# Object-Detection.
A computer vision project using YOLOv8 trained on a custom dataset. The system detects and classifies objects in static images with high accuracy. Built for educational and research purposes.

# 🔍 Smart Object Detection System

This project is an AI-powered object detection system that identifies and classifies objects like humans, vehicles, and animals in images using the YOLOv8 model. It is built for educational, research, and real-world deployment purposes.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Detects multiple object categories (e.g., humans, vehicles, animals)
- Trained on a custom dataset with YOLOv8
- User-friendly interface using Streamlit
- Supports image input for static analysis
